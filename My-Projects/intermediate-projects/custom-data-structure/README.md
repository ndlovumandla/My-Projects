Here’s an updated README that incorporates the specific output you provided, enhancing the clarity of expected outcomes when users run the project:

```markdown
# custom-data-structure

## Description
This project implements a custom data structure using a self-balancing tree (AVL Tree) and a Red-Black Tree. It provides functionalities for inserting, searching, deleting, and traversing nodes while maintaining balance for optimal performance. The implementation also includes performance comparisons with other data structures, highlighting efficiency in terms of time and space complexities.

### Expected Output
When running the application, you should expect outputs that showcase the following:
- **Insertion Results:** Confirmation of the time taken to insert elements into both trees:
  - Example: 
    ```
    Inserting elements...
    AVL Tree insertion time: 7249800 ns
    Red-Black Tree insertion time: 3902500 ns
    ```

- **Search Results:** Indication of whether specific elements were found in the trees:
  - Example: 
    ```
    Searching for 5000 in AVL Tree: false
    Searching for 5000 in Red-Black Tree: false
    ```

- **Deletion Results:** Confirmation of the deletion attempt and validation status:
  - Example:
    ```
    Deleted 5000 from AVL Tree. Validation status: true
    Couldn't find key in the tree
    Deleted 5000 from Red-Black Tree. Validation status: true
    ```

- **Validation Results:** Confirmation of the validation status of both trees:
  - Example:
    ```
    AVL Tree validation: true
    Red-Black Tree validation: true
    ```

## How to Run
1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ndlovumandla/My-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the 'custom-data-structure' folder:
   ```bash
   cd My-Projects/custom-data-structure
   ```
3. Compile and run the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile exec:java
   ```

## Technologies Used
- Java 11
- Maven
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of self-balancing trees and their operations.
- Experience with performance analysis and benchmarking of data structures.
- Proficiency in Java's object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Familiarity with Maven for project management and dependency handling.

## Future Improvements
- Implement additional data structures such as Red-Black Trees or B-Trees for comparison.
- Enhance the user interface to make it more interactive.
- Add more comprehensive performance metrics to evaluate space and time complexities across various operations.
- Incorporate unit tests using JUnit for better reliability and maintainability of the code.
